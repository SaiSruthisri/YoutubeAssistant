## Supported Languages (for translation)

- English, Hindi, French, Spanish, German, Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Arabic, Korean, Turkish, Vietnamese, Filipino, Japanese, Chinese

## Notes

- The transcript is fetched in the first available language (usually English).
- Summarization and Q&A use Gemini AI (Google Generative AI) in English, then translate to the user's language if needed.
- UI elements are translated instantly using deep-translator.
- For long transcripts, the app automatically chunks and summarizes in parts.
- Model and API limits are configurable in `config.py`.
- **Important:** Since this is a Streamlit app, always use the buttons in the intended order (e.g., Load Transcript ‚Üí Summarize ‚Üí Ask) to avoid losing data on the screen. Switching between buttons or reloading may reset the app state and clear your previous results or questions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Transcript not found:** Some videos may not have transcripts available.
- **API errors:** Ensure your API key is valid and you have internet access.
- **Text too long:** The app automatically splits long transcripts for summarization.
- **Language not available:** If the requested transcript language (e.g., Telugu) is not available, the app will use the first available language.
